== Upgrading From an Earlier Version
Instructions for how to upgrade from earlier versions of Spring Boot are provided on the project {github-wiki}[wiki].
Follow the links in the {github-wiki}#release-notes[release notes] section to find the version that you want to upgrade to.

Upgrading instructions are always the first item in the release notes.
If you are more than one release behind, please make sure that you also review the release notes of the versions that you jumped.

You should always ensure that you are running a {github-wiki}/Supported-Versions[supported version] of Spring Boot.
